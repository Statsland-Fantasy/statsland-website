## [PR-44]

### Added

- Order of sports in header (and default sport) handled by environment variables

- Changed way tiles are displayed (no more boolean[] to keep track of flips)
- Changed roundId separator to "#"
- Removed unnecessary pieces of GameState
- Now to get the round correct after a close guess, the next guess has to be closer than the previous to be accepted

## [PR-43]

### Added

### Changed

- Centralized and refactored environment variable usage

## [PR-42]

### Added

- Implement automatic user stats migration after first login

## [PR-40]

### Fixed

- Use UserStats model instead of new GuestStats model since the point of guest stats is that they will eventually be migrated to being a user anyways

## [PR-39]

### Added

- LocalStorage statistics tracking for guest (non-authenticated) users
  - Automatically saves comprehensive game statistics upon round completion
  - Storage key: `guestStats`
  - Tracks stats per sport: basketball, baseball, football
  - Statistics tracked include:
    - Total plays and percentage correct
    - Highest score and average correct score
    - Average number of tile flips
    - Most/least common tiles flipped (first, last, and overall)
    - Detailed tile flip trackers for all 9 tile types
  - Mirrors backend statistics calculation logic
  - Only updates stats for guest users (authenticated users use backend)
  - Console logging for debugging stats updates

### Changed

- Enhanced `useGameData` hook to accept `isGuest` parameter
- Updated `AthleteUnknown` component to detect authentication status
- Passes `!isAuthenticated` as `isGuest` to useGameData hook

### Technical Details

- Created `guestStats.ts` utility module with:
  - `GuestSportStats` interface matching backend stats model
  - `TileTracker` interface for tracking tile flip counts
  - `GuestGameResult` interface for game completion data
  - `loadGuestStats()` - Load all guest stats from localStorage
  - `updateGuestStats()` - Update stats with new game result
  - `clearGuestStats()` - Clear all guest stats
- Stats calculation includes:
  - Running averages for scores and tile flips
  - Percentage calculations
  - Tile frequency tracking across three dimensions
  - Most/least common tile determination

### Impact

- Guest users now have persistent statistics across sessions
- Enables future features like guest leaderboards
- Provides data for improving guest-to-authenticated conversion
- Stats format matches backend for seamless migration when user signs up

## [PR-38]

### Added

- LocalStorage persistence for mid-round game progress across all users
  - Automatically saves game state after each action (tile flips, guesses, score updates)
  - Restores in-progress games when user reopens tab or refreshes page
  - Storage key format: `currentSession_<sport>_<playDate>`
  - Saved data includes: score, tiles flipped, hints, guesses, messages, and all game state
  - Automatically clears saved progress when round is completed or user gives up
  - Console logging for debugging save/load/clear operations

### Changed

- Enhanced `useGameState` hook to automatically save and restore game progress
- Added `MidRoundProgress` interface for type-safe localStorage operations
- Extended storage utilities with new functions: `saveMidRoundProgress`, `loadMidRoundProgress`, `clearMidRoundProgress`

### Impact

- Users can now safely close/refresh the browser without losing their progress
- Improves user experience by eliminating frustration from accidental tab closures
- Works for both authenticated and guest users
- No performance impact - saves are non-blocking and use efficient localStorage API
